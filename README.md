# Image-Resizer-Tool
This Python script is designed to automate the task of resizing and converting images in bulk using the Pillow library. It reads all valid image files from a specified input folder and processes each one by resizing it to a target dimension (e.g., 800×600 pixels). The script ensures the output folder exists and saves the resized images in a chosen format like JPEG. To maintain compatibility with newer versions of Pillow, it uses `Image.Resampling.LANCZOS` for high-quality resizing instead of the deprecated `Image.ANTIALIAS`. Additionally, it handles transparency issues by converting images from `RGBA` to `RGB` when saving as JPEG, since JPEG doesn’t support alpha channels. This prevents runtime errors and ensures smooth processing. The script supports common image formats such as PNG, JPG, BMP, and WEBP, making it versatile for various use cases. It’s ideal for photographers, designers, or developers who need to prepare images for web or app deployment. With clear structure and error handling, it’s easy to customize for different dimensions or formats. Overall, this tool streamlines repetitive image tasks and enhances productivity.
